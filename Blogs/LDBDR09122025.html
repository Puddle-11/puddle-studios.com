                &emsp;&emsp;"There were two main issues relating to movement - one of which being related to Perforce, the other being related to the template map used. While working in an Unreal top-down template level, I was tasked with adding lateral and longitudinal movement using the keyboard so we can swap from using the touch-based movement system to a keyboard-based movement system and encountered issues relating to getting the player to move in the correct direction. The other issue relating to Perforce was that the modifications I made to the game were not able to be submitted on Perforce properly and the other team members were unable to get the changes I had made."

                &emsp;&emsp;
           "As for the lateral and longitudinal movement, the main issue was with the perspective - since this was a top-down game and not a first-person game, the camera is positioned in a different area so the math required to get the movement to work properly had to be modified. This required me to use the world's forward vector and the world's right vector instead of the camera's forward and right vector to ensure that the player moves in the correct direction that they want to go. The issues with Perforce were a bit more difficult to solve. After turning on syncing with version control in Unreal, I was able to properly sync up Unreal with Perforce so the changes I made would be able to be submitted; however, due to me making changes prior to setting up the version control in Unreal, I had to go into Perforce and manually add all of the files I had changed/added to be submitted into Perforce. After this, the files were able to be submitted and the other members were able to get the revisions."
