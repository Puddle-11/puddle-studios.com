                &emsp;&emsp;I’d say making the pause menu function was the issue that took the most time as during that time I would have multiple issues. One of the issues I had was that the game would pause but the ui would never show up, another issue happened when making the resume functionality which wouldn’t do anything if it was pressed.
                I fixed these issues by using breakpoints to find where the issues stemmed from. The first issue was because I never provided a HUD reference to unreal so it never knew what class it should be using for the pause menu not specifying results in an endless pause so all I needed to do was place a reference to the pause menu class into the character which resolved the issue. The second issue was because I had functionality in the pause menu to bring up the HUD but when pressing resume I would never take the UI off of the viewport. To fix this issue I needed to use the function in the UUserwidget class called “removefromviewport” which would take the pause UI off of the players screen.
