                &emsp;&emsp;When setting up the project in Perforce, the Perforce on my machine went smoothly; however, when incorporating my teammates into the project, there were some issues. The first issue we ran into was some users not being able to pull changes that other users submitted. The second issue we ran into was that the checked-out files were not being properly checked out and were causing conflicts. Finally, we had issues with someone's Perforce ignore file not working properly.

                &emsp;&emsp;These issues all cropped up within a couple of hours of each other, and as a result, we were able to deal with them all at once, quickly. The first issue we had to deal with was changes not showing to other users. For some reason, some users would submit to the Mechanical Gardens folder, and the change would not appear if you selected a subfolder. The solution we found was to always get revisions from the parent folder. The second issue was that the checked-out files were not checking out properly in Unreal. This was caused by a user improperly linking their Unreal to Perforce, which we fixed by logging them back in via their Unreal project. The final issue was an ignored file that was not working. I'm not sure why this happened, but we reset their workspace, and it worked. Overall, I think these problems were not as bad as they could be, and only set us back a few hours.
