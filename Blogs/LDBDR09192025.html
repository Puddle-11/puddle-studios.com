                &emsp;&emsp;Throughout this week, I had worked on an overworld map using a few plugins built into Unreal, one of those plugins was the Water plugin. Although there were not any issues with using the plugin itself, there was an issue which costed many hours when trying to build the application. While attempting to build, an error occurred in the build process which had to be resolved. The error message itself stated that there was an issue for the collision profile settings that did not include an entry for the water body collision profile. This is an issue due to it being required for the water collision to properly function
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;
                The main issue was dealing with adding the entry for the water body collision profile. On the error message itself, it had a button to add entry to DefaultEngine.ini; however, clicking this button did not do anything and did not help fix the issue. We had to go through the DefaultEngine.ini file manually and add the addition to the file. Afterword, we were able to build the project and successfully fix the issue.<br />
