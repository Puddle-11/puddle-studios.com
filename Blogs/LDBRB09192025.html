                &emsp;&emsp;
This week, I was tasked with creating a battle system, among other things, but it wasn't actually the battle system that gave me trouble. My main issue was the kill collider, a collider that will teleport you back to the main menu if you hit it. I made this to ensure the player stays on the map.
This was my first time interacting with and assigning variables in the scene view for Unreal, so I was unsure how to do it. The way I made the collider was that the dev would drag in another object, a target object, onto the kill collider, and when hit, it would teleport the player to that object. I was unsure how to do this in Unreal; in Unity, it's straightforward forward, but for Unreal, I wasn't sure it was going to be as simple.

                &emsp;&emsp;In the end, it was quite easy; a simple exposed field in the blueprint did the trick, and I was able to drag and drop the item with no problem. Navigating the menus to get to that option, though, was different than what I was used to and threw me for a loop. Unreal has a lot of extraneous variables for its objects, which I dont like. The number of variables they have is way out of proportion, and a lot can be set programmatically instead of being on the HUD. Overall, I have my complaints with Unreal, but I overcame this issue. 
Attached are screenshots of the scene with the collider to show how I did this.
