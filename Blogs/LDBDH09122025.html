                &emsp;&emsp;For a small amount of time i had an issue with perforce where I was not able to get my changes to perforce and have my team members be able to see the changes I made in unreal. While I could see the changes my team members couldn't.
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After some more research I figured out that the issue was the way I was submitting my changes. Instead of submitting the changes to the entire folder my issue was that I was submitting the changes while highlighting a single folder meaning all the changes couldn't go through as I was changing more than just the one folder. I fixed my issue by submitting the changes while highlighting the folder that contained the entire project.
