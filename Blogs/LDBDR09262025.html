                In one of the previous sprints, I had made an overworld map which was very big and had a lot of foliage. Although there wasn't much of an issue with the foliage, there was an issue with the grass. The grass lagged the game horribly and brought the game down from 60 fps to 25 fps. With the map being so big and there being so much grass in the world, this would be a huge issue for the user experience and was a priority for something I needed to fix before the build.
                <br />
                <br />

                Since the grass was the main issue, I decided to remake the grass entirely using the foliage brush. Originally, the grass was part of the material I was using so I decided to go into the material and disable the option to make the grass. After that, using the foliage mode I went and added grass across the world manually with a very low density to prevent there from being as much grass in the overworld. This was able to fix the issue properly and the fps went back up to a constant 60 fps. I believe the original issue was mainly due to the previous grass being too dense and there being too many animations on the grass playing at the same time and so lowering the amount of grass there was made it so the game ran smoother.
